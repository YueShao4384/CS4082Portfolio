                        <p class="question">I am a computer science major, my curiosity about computer development prompted me to choose this major, and after
                        learning a certain amount about computers, I became interested in software development and wanted to develop
                        applications that really help people's lives.
                        When I entered college, I began to delve into the core concepts of software development, including data structures,
                        database management, and front- and back-end development. In the process, I became more interested in Python's wide
                        range of applications in data processing and artificial intelligence. In addition, I was introduced to HTML, CSS and
                        JavaScript and tried to develop simple web applications.
                        In my future study life, I hope to learn more about software development and look forward to participating in teamwork
                        and improving myself in practice!
