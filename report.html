                <a href="index.html" target="_blank">link</a>
                to my portfolio page

            <h2>1. Introduction</h2>
            <p>This report outlines the development process of my personal portfolio website, describing the purpose of
                the site, the design and implementation process, the testing results, and a summary reflection upon
                completion.</p>
        </div>
        <div class="content-div">
            <h2>2. Purpose</h2>
            <p>The main purpose of this portfolio website is to showcase my academic background, technical skills, and
                future goals. This webpage, when completed, should be able to serve as an online resume, allowing those
                viewing the build to learn more about my major and learning experiences.</p>

            <h2>3. Design and Implementation</h2>
            <h3>3.1 Technologies Used</h3>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>HTML:</strong> Use HTML to build the structure of the web page, completing various parts of
                    the content.</li>
                <li><strong>CSS (Bootstrap framework):</strong> The use of the Bootstrap framework improves the overall
                    structure and design of the webpage. Custom CSS is applied to enhance the aesthetics and
                    responsiveness.</li>
            </ul>
            <h3>3.2 Page Structure</h3>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>About Me:</strong> Introduction with my name and academic background.</li>
                <li><strong>Skills & Interests:</strong> A table summarizing my programming skills and expertise.</li>
                <li><strong>Future Goals:</strong> Describes the goals I expect to learn in the future in my area of
                    specialization.</li>
                <li><strong>Reflection & Future Plans:</strong> Self-reflection on the websiteâ€™s current state and areas
                    for improvement.</li>
                <li><strong>Design Process:</strong> A visual representation of my thought process during development.
                </li>
            </ul>
            <h3>3.3 Styling and Layout</h3>
            <p>The webpage uses Bootstrap components for responsiveness. Custom CSS was used to style the page,
                including dynamic styling where the background color changes with screen width and styled tables and
                text sections for better readability.</p>
            <p>A flexbox layout ensures adaptability across devices.</p>

            <h2>4. Conclusion</h2>
            <p>This personal portfolio website exemplifies my skills and future goals in the computer science program. I
                utilized HTML and CSS to design the entire webpage. However, the webpage is weak in terms of dynamic
                functionality and interactivity. Next, I will continue to improve the webpage by using JavaScript and
                other tools to enhance interactivity with the viewer.</p>
